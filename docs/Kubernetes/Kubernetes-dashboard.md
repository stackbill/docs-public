# Kubernetes Dashboard

[Kubernetes](https://www.CloudPortal.com/CloudPortal-kubernetes.html) in [CloudPortal CMP is an open-source container-orchestration   ](https://youtu.be/nyV8oE3dfXs) system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of **containerized applications**. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem and the services, support, and tools are widely available. **Kubernetes** provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently.

- Using [CloudPortal Cloud Management Portal](https://www.CloudPortal.com/index.html), You can quickly launch the **Kubernetes master**, worker nodes and get started working with your **Kubernetes cluster** in a minute.

- **Kubernetes Dashboard**   offers you various functionality such as Resource Monitoring, Resize, Auto scaling, Load balancer, etc..,

- The **K8S dashboard in CloudPortal CMP** will be helpful to users who are unfamiliar with Kubernetes.

## K8S Summary in CloudPortal CMP

- The first page of your **Kubernetes cluster** is the **Summary page.** 
- **CloudPortal CMP** provides the overall view of your **Kubernetes cluster.**
- Detailed information about your **plan, Kubernetes version, cluster IP**, and more can be found on the **details page**

## Networking

- **Kubernetes dashboard** will also provide you the detailed information about your cluster networking.

- This section contains four sub-categories, they are: **Network**, **Firewall**, **Port forwarding** & **Load Balancer**.

- Network category will show you the all available networking which are attached with your cluster and its nodes.

- Firewall tab will display list of ports which are opened for your cluster public IP. Also, you can add your custom ports that required for your applications.

- You can configure port forwarding to allow external traffic to reach your virtual machines (VMs) by forwarding specific ports to the VMs.

- A load balancer is a device or software that distributes network traffic across multiple servers or virtual machines (VMs) to ensure that no single machine is overloaded with traffic. You can use the built-in load balancing feature to distribute traffic to multiple VMs.

### Marketplace

- Currently we are working towards **Kubernetes marketplace** apps for customer featured applications.

### Monitoring

- **CloudPortal** working towards integrating stackwatch.io as official monitoring service for the virtual resource. Once the integration is completed, we will share more information on this.
